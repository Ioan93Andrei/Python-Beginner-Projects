# Guess-the-number-game

Just a little "Guess the number game" to practice basic programming concepts like while loops and if conditionals. 

In the game you must chose a randomly generated number between 0 and 500. If the number chosen is either lower or higher than the randomly chosen number, the terminal will tell you that.
When the random number is guessed the game congratulates you and quits.
